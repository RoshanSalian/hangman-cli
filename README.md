# Details
Fetches data related to a genre from the [DataMuse](https://www.datamuse.com/api/) API and gives a random word (currently) from the JSON to the user to guess. Later versions will prefer words based on difficulty and relevance.

<br>

# Run
Download the linux executable and run 
`chmod +x hangman`
to make it executable and run it with `./hangman`


<br>

### TODO
- [ ] loop and points
- [ ] set difficulty
- [ ] better api?
- [ ] offline support for specific topics only
